# Counter-App
In this Counter App we have 2 buttons one is Add value and another one is Subtract Value and I have put a onclick function on each buttons,
when user click on "Add Value button" value will be increased by 1 and at the same time when user click on the "Subtract Value button",
value will be decreased by 1.

But There is a Interesting Catch --
That it is I have put a Conditional rendering on it. if user click a "Add Value button" the value will be increased by 1 until the value does not
reach to 20. so as the value reached the 20 ..Condition will be true and onclick will not work and the value won't be increased by 1, And it will be same
on the "Subtract Value button" if the user click on Subtract value button the value will be decreased by 1 until the value does not reach to 0,
so as the value reached the 0 ..Condition will be true and onclick will not work and the value won't be decreased by 1.
